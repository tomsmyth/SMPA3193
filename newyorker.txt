According to the data, out of the 1,810 characters that appeared in New Yorker cartoons throughout 2014, a massive majority of them were white and male.  Close to 95% of the characters were white and over 70% were men.  The data also provided insight into which cartoonists drew the most female and non-white characters, Hwang and Suits respectively, both of whom are women.  When it comes to characters who were both non-white and female, they made up only 1.3% of the total population.  Ultimately, the data demonstrates that male and white characters made up the majority of cartoon characters in the New Yorker in 2014.
